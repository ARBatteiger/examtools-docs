## Sandbox/Training Environment
For training purposes, use the ExamTools (ET) sandbox environment at https://examtools.dev.   Training sessions which are created in the sandbox will be found on https://hamstudy.dev.  Use hamstudy.dev to register your practice applicants for your training session.

VEs who want access to the sandbox will need to register for a sandbox ET account even if they already have a production ET account. Team leads will need to request session manager permissions be added to their sandbox account in order to create and run practice sessions.  All features available in production can be tested out and mastered in the sandbox before a live session is scheduled.  

If you do not have enough real VEs to train with, you can use dummy VEs.

## Dummy VEs:

Dummy practice VEs can only be used with assigning to an applicant and signing; they use a special callsign format like E92USR -- E means "Extra class" (and G means “General”), 92 can be any 2 digit number, and USR is just a common suffix eg. G23USR, E12USR, etc.
The password for each account is passwordNN where NN is the number, so for E46USR, the password is password46.  If you put in the wrong password, ET will prompt with a hint.


## Rules for Dummies:

* Use E or G for the license class prefix.
* The two digits can range from 01-99.
* Suffix should always be USR (user).
> E01ABC is not a valid dummy VE.  
* You cannot login to ET with a dummy account.

If you use a “T” as a prefix,  you will get the tech error and you will not be able to use the dummy VE.  May be good for demo purposes only.
