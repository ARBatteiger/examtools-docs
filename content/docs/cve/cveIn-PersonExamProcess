# In-Person Exams with ExamTools

Session Manager (SM) creates a session on ExamTools (ET). [link]

SM or co-owner adds participating Volunteer Examiners (VEs) to the session. [link]

**Applicant Registration:**

1. PRE-REGISTER: Direct applicants to pre-register (and pay) before the exam by using the link on HamStudy. The link can be public which would allow anyone who searched HamStudy to register or private where only those who have the link can access the session listing and register. [link]
2. WALK-INS: If you allow walk-ins on the day of the exam, a VE can help folks register.

- On [http://ham.study](http://ham.study/), have the applicant use their own device (a smartphone or tablet) or one provided by a VE. ![](RackMultipart20210428-4-8m29aq_html_65b144bab109ee83.png)
- In ExamTools, a VE can register folks using the Add Applicant feature located in the upper right corner of the applicants list.

Applicants do not need to bring a 605, but they do need to bring an ID. A VE should confirm FRNs and callsigns on the ULS. All applicants need a FRN. An email address is strongly suggested and will be required in the future by FCC. If an email is not provided, the applicant will need to log in to obtain a copy of their license.

**Paper or Device?**

- Paper exam booklets, figure sheets and answer sheets must be printed from ET by a SM. The paper exams are reusable, printed with or without figures, randomly generated and have unique serial numbers. Font size is adjustable. Should be printed on white paper. Select exams to be graded by GradeCam.
- Devices (computers, tablets, smartphones) may be owned by the applicants, VEs or VEC.
- Exam results may be shared depending on your VEC&#39;s policy. Generally, when exams are graded by GradeCam, ET results may or may not be shared depending on the number of versions of the exam you have and if the exam is to be reused. On devices, exam results may be shared as each exam is randomly generated. It would always be safe to provide the universal question number (i.e. T6A07) to the applicant as these are in the public domain.

**Check in Applicants:**

- Check ID and collect any fee from applicants.
- Use a paper roster (for GLAARG, [https://glaarg.org/session-rosters/](https://glaarg.org/session-rosters/)) to track payment and ID check or download an applicant list from ExamTools and add columns for both. Defer to your VEC for direction.

Optional: Change their status from &quot;Registered&quot; to &quot;Seen&quot; in ExamTools to indicate that the applicant has checked in and is testing.

Optional: Provide the applicant with a label name tag with the pin written below to help with identifying who they are. Similar to what we do in ZOOM [Pin + first name + element].

**Start Exam:**

- SM should &quot;Start&quot; the session in ET. [link]

**To test with paper** , provide each applicant with an exam, a figure sheet, a bubble answer sheet, pencil and calculator, if needed. The applicant may choose to use the back of the answer sheet for scratch paper.

Each answer sheet should be prefilled with the exam&#39;s serial number and the applicant&#39;s pin.

A VE may seat the applicant and give instructions on what to do when they have completed their exam.

Optional: Provide each applicant with an instruction or exam cover sheet to explain what to do during the exam and what to do to have the exam scored.

Optional: Buy brightly colored folders to keep track of exams and elements. Although print exams on white printer paper as some people have trouble reading on colored paper, place the exams in folders or use cover sheets. GLAARG Cover Sheets: Tech = bright yellow, General = Goldenrod, Extra = Teal Blue, but you can choose your own. GLAARG will also supply exams, if you give them enough lead time.

**To test with a device** , provide each applicant with a sheet of blank paper, a pencil and calculator, if needed. Inspect the device as you would for remote testing. The applicant needs only a web browser open and should be instructed to remain on that page only. Settings, profiles, and/or apps (i.e. Fully Kiosk) maybe used to secure VE team owned devices.

The applicant should go to [http://exam.tools](http://exam.tools/) and join the session with the SM&#39;s call sign and the applicant&#39;s pin. A VE will need to authorize at points in the exam as they would during a remote exam.

**During Exam:**

For both paper and device testing, VEs should be assigned to monitor the applicants. Walk around behind the applicants with devices and make sure that they stay on the exam page. VEs will need to assign themselves or a VE Admin or higher can assign Certifying VEs to each applicant.

The team should determine how they want the applicants to signal that they are done with the exam. For an exam taken on a device, the applicant can hit the grade exam button. For those who are using paper, they may need to raise their hand or bring their exam and materials to a specific table to be graded. All materials, pencil and calculators should be collected from the applicants.

**Grading Exams:**

For applicants using a device, they can proceed through the exam process as if they are being tested online.

For paper exams, use GradeCam to grade the exam.

**Viewing 605 and Draft CSCE:**

All applicants should be able to sign in or remain signed in using their own device (a smart phone) or one (a tablet, iPad, computer) provided to them to view their score, finish and sign forms (view 605/CSCE and create an electronic signature). For paper exam applicants, you can skip right to the 605/CSCE and signature by changing the applicant status to &quot;Ready to Sign&quot; in ET.

**Official Certificate of Successful Completion:**

Once the applicant and three Certifying VEs have signed, the SM or a co-owner should &quot;Mark Complete&quot; the applicant and send the CSCE. The applicant should check their email which they used to register and confirm that they received the CSCE.

**Applicants who did not pass** will not receive anything unless the team would like to either print or email the applicants the 605 from ET. Depending on the team&#39;s point of view, &quot;returning the 605&quot; is completely unnecessary as the applicant did not provide a 605 when registering. Common practice for the three certifying VEs is to remain assigned to the non-passing applicant. Although ExamTools will allow VEs to sign a 605 on which &quot;NO NEW LICENSE OR UPGRADE WAS EARNED&quot;, most all teams do not sign. Check with your VEC for direction.

**At the end of the session,** the SM cleans up the manifest, will remove any non-participating VEs and any that did. Optionally, remove applicants who did not show. Then &quot;Finalize&quot; the session.

Session Manager submits session docs to the Volunteer Examiner Coordinator (VEC) along with any other requested documentation (i.e. expense report, CSCEs, etc).

**VEC upload, licenses and upgrades:**

Once the VEC has uploaded the batch file from the session, the FCC will process to review the applications and for most approve and issue callsigns the same day. When this happens, the applicant should get an email from Exam Tools and the FCC on Monday for weekend exams, if everything goes well with our upload. The email from the FCC comes overnight with a link to the official license. The applicant should download the license from the link, maybe rename it something other than what it is called (just a long string of numbers) and save it in a place where they can find it again. They may choose to print out a copy and keep it with their radio.

Those who upgraded can use their existing call sign appended with /AG (General) or /AE (Extra) right now to try out their new privileges. Those who do not have a license will need to wait until their call sign appears in the ULS which should be sometime during the day. Occasionally, applicants need to wait an additional day or two while their application is in review.

The FCC issues callsigns during business hours Monday through Friday. If an applicant tests early enough on a weekday, the applicant could possibly see their application processed the same day, but should expect 5-7 days processing time.

**Flow of applicants through exam site:**

Tables should be set up to allow a logical flow through each station. This is an example below.

![](RackMultipart20210428-4-8m29aq_html_e19ecc1b6d76d507.gif)

1. Registration
2. Payment of fee (if not free)
3. Check-in &amp; Present ID
4. Receive Exam
5. Take Exam
6. Return Exam
7. Grade Exam [VEs sign/SM marks complete/send CSCE]
8. Receive CSCE

**Applicant Email Address:**

All applicants are encouraged to provide an email address on all applications. When an email is provided, the licensees will receive an electronic issuance of an official copy of their licenses upon application grant. Certain email preferences and email services may potentially block or filter incoming email attachments. Applicants should set their email preferences to allow incoming email from authorizations@fcc.gov before their applications are submitted.

If no email address is provided, the licensees will need to login to ULS and download their authorizations, as no paper copies are distributed. The instructions for downloading an authorization can be found at: [https://www.fcc.gov/support/universal-licensing-system-uls-resources/how-obtain-official-authorizations-uls](https://www.fcc.gov/support/universal-licensing-system-uls-resources/how-obtain-official-authorizations-uls). Email questions about this process to [ulsebf@fcc.gov](mailto:ulsebf@fcc.gov).

**Basic Qualification Question:**

If an applicant answers &quot;Yes&quot; to this question not only should the SM confirm that the answer is correct, but make it clear that there are additional steps to their application with the FCC. Providing the application file number and the instructions on the back of the 605 may be needed. This may be the first time the applicant has applied for an amateur radio license and may need a little extra explanation.
