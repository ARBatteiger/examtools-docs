## About

Over the past eleven years Richard Bateman KD7BBC and a close-knit team of volunteers have been developing, administering, and hosting web-based software applications that improve how people study for, take and administer amateur radio license exams. The results of this labor are [HamStudy](http://Ham.Study) and [ExamTools](http://exam.tools). These projects are funded primarily through proceeds from [SignalStuff](http://signalstuff.com), an antenna design and development company Richard started which is known for its highly acclaimed Signal Stick antennas for handheld amateur radios, with additional support from [Icom America](https://www.icomamerica.com/). HamStudy provides web-based and mobile device applications to help people effectively study for amateur license exams by incorporating flash cards and practice exams. ExamTools supports the creation of randomized license exams for Amateur Radio Element 2 (*Technician*), Element 3 (*General*), and Element 4 (*Amateur Extra*) testing. Exam grading was built into the computer-based testing tool along with digital reporting of exam results to support the Volunteer Examiners (VEs) and the Volunteer Examiners Coordinator (VEC) organizations. The success of in-person computer-based exams via ExamTools laid the foundation for the expansion of ExamTools into fully-remote Amateur Radio license testing.

Beginning in the Spring of 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic had seriously restricted the ability to hold in-person amateur radio license testing. To address the pent up demand for license testing a Fully-Remote Working Group representing several VECs was formed to determine how fully-remote exams could be developed and implemented consistent with the FCC authorization of remote exams (in [FCC Report & Order 14-74](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-modifies-amateur-service-testing-and-emission-rules)) and in concert with VEC guidelines. The first iteration of fully-remote testing using an expanded version of ExamTools called “Tier 1” became available in late March of 2020 and the very first fully-remote exam session was held on March 26, 2020. Though the session was successful, the process was cumbersome and required remote access to the candidate’s computer by each of the three signing VEs. To improve the workflow and operation of remote testing, ExamTools Tier 2 was developed and released on May 26, 2020 providing integrated digital signatures for the candidate and the signing VEs, as well as a fully integrated environment for the management, administration and reporting of fully-remote exam sessions.

ExamTools continues to be vigorously used by four VEC organizations which from March through November 2020 have tested over 4,000 candidates. The ExamTools application continues to be enhanced based on inputs from active VEs and the support of a committed team of volunteers that assist Richard in the design, development, testing, documentation and training of the ExamTools application. Future enhancements of ExamTools could integrate digital payment, video conferencing and VE chat functionalities which are currently performed using stand-alone applications. ExamTools has provided a world-class computer-based fully-remote testing environment that is efficient and scalable to support the continued growth of the amateur radio community.
